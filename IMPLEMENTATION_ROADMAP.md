## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Performance Impact of Metrics
**Mitigation:**
- Benchmark metrics collection overhead
- Use sampling for high-volume metrics
- Implement metrics toggle via feature flag

### Risk 2: Trace Storage Growth
**Mitigation:**
- Configure 7-day retention in Jaeger
- Implement trace sampling (1% initially)
- Monitor storage usage

### Risk 3: Alert Fatigue
**Mitigation:**
- Conservative alert thresholds initially
- Alert grouping by severity
- Runbooks for all alerts
- Regular alert tuning based on production data

### Risk 4: Backward Compatibility
**Mitigation:**
- Feature flags for new monitoring code
- Graceful degradation if metrics fail
- Incremental rollout to staging first

---

## Rollout Plan

### Stage 1: Development Environment
- Deploy to local dev environment
- Verify all metrics collected
- Test alert firing
- Verify trace collection

### Stage 2: CI/CD Integration
- Add monitoring tests to pipeline
- Verify in integration test environment
- Load test with monitoring enabled

### Stage 3: Staging Deployment
- Deploy full monitoring stack to staging
- Run for 48 hours
- Verify no performance degradation
- Test alert notifications

### Stage 4: Production Deployment
- Deploy Prometheus + Jaeger to production
- Enable metrics collection (no alerts yet)
- Monitor for 24 hours
- Gradually enable alerts
- Full monitoring operational
