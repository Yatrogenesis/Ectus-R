## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Performance Impact of Metrics
**Mitigation:**
- Benchmark metrics collection overhead
- Use sampling for high-volume metrics
- Implement metrics toggle via feature flag

### Risk 2: Trace Storage Growth
**Mitigation:**
- Configure 7-day retention in Jaeger
- Implement trace sampling (1% initially)
- Monitor storage usage

### Risk 3: Alert Fatigue
**Mitigation:**
- Conservative alert thresholds initially
- Alert grouping by severity
- Runbooks for all alerts
- Regular alert tuning based on production data

### Risk 4: Backward Compatibility
**Mitigation:**
- Feature flags for new monitoring code
- Graceful degradation if metrics fail
- Incremental rollout to staging first

---

## Rollout Plan
