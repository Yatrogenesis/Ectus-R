Ectus-R is an autonomous software engineering platform that transforms complex business requirements into complete, production-ready applications. Through a conversational or descriptive interface, Ectus-R designs architecture, generates source code, writes tests, configures deployment infrastructure, and validates software quality.

Ectus-R is a system that analyzes requirements to build custom solutions. Powered by the AION-R AI inference engine, Ectus-R is built in Rust for performance, security, and efficiency in the software development lifecycle.

## Why Ectus-R?

Traditional software development involves trade-offs between speed, quality, and cost. Ectus-R addresses these challenges through three core principles:

### 1. Development Speed
Software that typically takes months to design and build can be generated in minutes. Ectus-R automates low-level tasks (configuration, boilerplate code, testing) and high-level tasks (architecture design, pattern selection), allowing teams to focus on business logic and innovation.

**Implementation:** Asynchronous and parallel code generation.

**Result:** Significant reduction in time from idea to production.

### 2. Quality and Security by Design
Every line of code generated by Ectus-R is analyzed, tested, and validated against industry standards. The system writes code and generates unit and integration tests, entering an auto-correction loop until quality is verified.

**Implementation:** AI engine with "Generation and Verification" cycle, static analysis, and integrated vulnerability scanning.

**Result:** Software with low defect rates and minimal common vulnerabilities from the first commit.

### 3. Resource Efficiency
Built on AION-R (Rust), software generated by Ectus-R and the platform itself are natively efficient. They consume fewer resources (CPU and memory) compared to applications built with traditional stacks like Python or Node.js.

**Implementation:** Compiled binaries, garbage collector-free, and memory-safe design.

**Result:** Reduced cloud infrastructure costs and lower carbon footprint.

## What's New in v1.0

###  Multi-Provider LLM Integration
- **5 LLM Providers:** Groq (fastest), OpenAI (highest quality), GitHub Models (free), HuggingFace (open models), Cloudflare AI (edge latency)
- **Automatic Fallback:** If one provider fails, automatically tries the next
- **Zero Vendor Lock-in:** Switch providers anytime or use your own API keys
- **Cost Optimization:** Free tiers available (Groq, GitHub Models)

[Learn more about LLM integration →](crates/aion-ai-engine/src/llm_providers.rs)

###  Enterprise-Grade Security
- **OWASP Top 10 Compliance:** 100% addressed (8/10 fully mitigated, 2/10 user-configurable)
- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** CI/CD integration with `cargo audit` and `npm audit`
- **Secure by Default:** Argon2 password hashing, ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption, JWT tokens
- **Incident Response:** Documented procedures and contact channels

[Read full security policy →](SECURITY.md)

###  Proven Performance
- **50-400x Faster:** Simple APIs in 11.3s (vs 2-4 hours manually)
- **Real Benchmarks:** Detailed metrics for code generation, testing, and refactoring
- **Cost Savings:** 99.74%-99.93% reduction in development costs
- **Quality Metrics:** 95.6% QA success rate, <0.1% error rate

[View detailed benchmarks →](BENCHMARKS.md)

###  Locked Files Protection
- **Manual Edit Safety:** Automatically detects files with uncommitted changes
- **No Overwriting:** Creates `.aion-suggested` files instead of overwriting
- **Git Integration:** Uses git diff to identify human-modified files
- **Configuration:** Simple `.aion-locked` file for permanent protection

[See locked files documentation →](crates/aion-ai-engine/src/locked_files.rs)

###  Clear Commercial Licensing
- **Free for Startups:** < $1M ARR uses MIT License (no cost)
- **Transparent Tiers:** $499/mo ($1-10M ARR), $2499/mo ($10M+ ARR)
- **What You Get:** Production use, unlimited developers, security updates, support
- **AI-Generated Code:** You own all code generated by AION-R

[Review licensing terms →](LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md)

###  Simplified Development
- **Minimal Docker Compose:** 2 services instead of 9 (300MB vs 2GB RAM)
- **Faster Startup:** ~5s vs ~30s for full stack
- **Lower Barrier:** Get started without complex infrastructure
- **Production Path:** Easy upgrade to full observability stack

## Main Features

**Requirements Analysis:** Understands natural language prompts or structured specifications (JSON/YAML) to derive technical requirements.

**Dynamic Solution Architecture:** Designs optimal architectures (monoliths, microservices, serverless) based on project requirements.

**Full-Stack Code Generation:** Produces idiomatic, high-quality code for frontend (React, Vue, Svelte), backend (Rust, Go, Node.js), databases (SQL, migrations), and more.

**Quality and Testing System:** Automatically generates and executes unit and integration tests, debugging code until defined quality thresholds are met.

**Integrated DevOps Automation:** Generates optimized Dockerfiles, docker-compose configurations, and Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, HPA) for immediate deployment.

**Extensible Ecosystem:** Designed with plugin architecture to support new languages, frameworks, and cloud providers.

## How It Works - Autonomous Development Lifecycle

Ectus-R emulates the process of a software engineering team in an automated, high-speed cycle.
