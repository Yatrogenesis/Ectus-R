Ectus-R is an autonomous software engineering platform that transforms complex business requirements into complete, production-ready applications. Through a conversational or descriptive interface, Ectus-R designs architecture, generates source code, writes tests, configures deployment infrastructure, and validates software quality.

Ectus-R is a system that analyzes requirements to build custom solutions. Powered by the AION-R AI inference engine, Ectus-R is built in Rust for performance, security, and efficiency in the software development lifecycle.

## Why Ectus-R?

Traditional software development involves trade-offs between speed, quality, and cost. Ectus-R addresses these challenges through three core principles:

### 1. Development Speed
Software that typically takes months to design and build can be generated in minutes. Ectus-R automates low-level tasks (configuration, boilerplate code, testing) and high-level tasks (architecture design, pattern selection), allowing teams to focus on business logic and innovation.

**Implementation:** Asynchronous and parallel code generation.

**Result:** Significant reduction in time from idea to production.

### 2. Quality and Security by Design
Every line of code generated by Ectus-R is analyzed, tested, and validated against industry standards. The system writes code and generates unit and integration tests, entering an auto-correction loop until quality is verified.

**Implementation:** AI engine with "Generation and Verification" cycle, static analysis, and integrated vulnerability scanning.

**Result:** Software with low defect rates and minimal common vulnerabilities from the first commit.

### 3. Resource Efficiency
Built on AION-R (Rust), software generated by Ectus-R and the platform itself are natively efficient. They consume fewer resources (CPU and memory) compared to applications built with traditional stacks like Python or Node.js.

**Implementation:** Compiled binaries, garbage collector-free, and memory-safe design.

**Result:** Reduced cloud infrastructure costs and lower carbon footprint.

## Main Features

**Requirements Analysis:** Understands natural language prompts or structured specifications (JSON/YAML) to derive technical requirements.

**Dynamic Solution Architecture:** Designs optimal architectures (monoliths, microservices, serverless) based on project requirements.

**Full-Stack Code Generation:** Produces idiomatic, high-quality code for frontend (React, Vue, Svelte), backend (Rust, Go, Node.js), databases (SQL, migrations), and more.

**Quality and Testing System:** Automatically generates and executes unit and integration tests, debugging code until defined quality thresholds are met.

**Integrated DevOps Automation:** Generates optimized Dockerfiles, docker-compose configurations, and Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, HPA) for immediate deployment.

**Extensible Ecosystem:** Designed with plugin architecture to support new languages, frameworks, and cloud providers.

## How It Works - Autonomous Development Lifecycle

Ectus-R emulates the process of a software engineering team in an automated, high-speed cycle.

## Example: Creating a REST API

```bash
# 1. Iniciar el CLI interactivo de Ectus-R
ectus-r new

# 2. Describir la aplicación (Ejemplo de prompt)
> Create a production-ready REST API for a blog.
> It needs users and posts.
> Use Rust with Axum for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database.
> Include JWT authentication for creating posts.
> Generate unit tests and a multi-stage Dockerfile.
