## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-29

### Added

#### Autonomous QA Engine
- Unlimited Iterations: QA engine now runs until quality targets are achieved across all dimensions
- Comprehensive Quality Assessment: 8-dimension quality evaluation:
  - Functional correctness (unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests)
  - Code quality (style, complexity, maintainability metrics)
  - Security analysis (vulnerability scanning, secure coding practices)
  - Performance benchmarking (load testing, profiling, optimization)
  - Maintainability assessment (readability, documentation, modularity)
  - Test quality analysis (coverage, assertions, test design)
  - Documentation completeness (API docs, inline comments, examples)
  - Accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines, semantic HTML)
- Real Test Execution: Actual command execution with proper test result parsing
- Intelligent Bottleneck Detection: Automatic identification of quality blockers
- Safety Mechanisms: Protection against infinite iteration loops

#### Enterprise Web Dashboard
- Real-time API Integration: Live connection to Ectus-R SaaS backend with fallback to mock data
- Project Management: Direct deployment and status monitoring
- Auto-refresh System: Real-time updates every 30 seconds
- Monitoring: Live status indicators and deployment management
- TypeScript Integration: Full type safety with React hooks

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Generation
- Multi-cloud Support: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and Kubernetes
- Enterprise Resources: Advanced networking, security, monitoring, and compliance
- Security Hardening: WAF, SSL/TLS termination, DDoS protection, VPN gateways
- Scalability Features: Auto-scaling groups, load balancers, CDN integration
- Compliance Integration: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 configurations built-in
- Cost Optimization: Resource tagging, budget alerts, reserved instance management

#### Refactoring Engine
- Comprehensive Code Analysis: 269 refactoring operations across all language constructs
- Technical Debt Detection: Identification of code smells, security vulnerabilities, performance issues
- Pattern Recognition: ML-based detection of anti-patterns and improvement opportunities
- Safety-first Transformations: Backup/restore mechanisms with safety validation
- Test Generation: Automatic test creation for refactored code
- Impact Assessment: ROI analysis and risk evaluation for each improvement

#### Security & Reliability Enhancements
- Domain Redirect Fix: Resolved creator.avermex.com pointing to non-existent API
- API Integration Stability: Robust fallback mechanisms and error handling
- Enterprise Monitoring: Comprehensive observability and alerting systems
- Production-ready Deployment: Complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

### Changed

#### Quality Assurance Improvements
- Unlimited QA Iterations: Removed artificial 5-iteration limit, system now continues until quality targets achieved
- Bottleneck Detection: Improved identification and resolution of quality blockers
- Test Coverage: Expanded testing across unit, integration, E2E, security, and performance domains

#### Architecture Enhancements
- Multi-cloud IaC: Expanded from basic resources to enterprise-grade infrastructure patterns
- Real Backend Integration: Moved from mock data to live API connections with graceful degradation
- Monitoring: Advanced observability with metrics, logging, and alerting

### Fixed

#### Domain & API Issues
- creator.avermex.com Redirect: Fixed domain pointing to working API endpoint (`ectus-r-saas.pako-molina.workers.dev`)
- API Connection Stability: Resolved intermittent connection issues with fallback mechanisms
- Dashboard Real-time Updates: Fixed data synchronization and auto-refresh functionality

#### Code Quality & Testing
- QA Engine Execution: Resolved placeholder implementations with real test execution
- Test Result Parsing: Fixed proper parsing and analysis of test outputs
- Quality Metrics: Corrected calculation of comprehensive quality scores
